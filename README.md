# iOS Spotify Sidestore

This repository provides access to Spotify app fetching IPAs directly from Eevee Spotify. The primary purpose is to add a convenient resource tab in Sidestore, allowing for easy installation and automatic updates.

### Add This Repository to AltStore Beta or Sidestore

To enable automatic updates and easy access to this app, follow these steps:

1. Open AltStore or Sidestore and go to the **Browse** tab.
2. Tap **Sources** in the top-right corner.
3. Tap the **+** button and add my source URL: `https://tinyurl.com/akaSpotify`
4. Now, a "Spotify" app will appear in the **Browse** tab, where you can install and update that directly from within AltStore or Sidestore.
